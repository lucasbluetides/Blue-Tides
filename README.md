# Blue-Tides
This all started with a documentary chasing coral. The films message about corals bleaching and the overall fragility of marine life stayed with me during one of my daily training runs along the harbour side. That's when I realized what we have currently is not enough. I began using my skill to build Blue Tides, raising awareness across the world.
